# Comparing-Conversion-of-Bidding-Methods-with-AB-Testing
This project involves comparing the effectiveness of two bidding methods, "maximum bidding" and "average bidding," through an A/B test. The goal is to determine whether the "average bidding" method yields more conversions compared to the existing "maximum bidding" method.
